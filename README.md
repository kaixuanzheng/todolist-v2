# todolist-v2
In This project, I create a to-do list app by node.js.
This app will automatically create a new to-do list page with the title of the current date every day. https://todolist-2022.herokuapp.com/
You can create the new title to-do list just simple type forward slash with your title name, e.g."/work" https://todolist-2022.herokuapp.com/Work
This project is published by Heroku and the database is served by MongoDB.
